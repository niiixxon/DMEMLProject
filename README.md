# Predictions of Credit Card Approval

## Overview

This project aimed to analyze and model a dataset using various machine learning algorithms to predict a target variable. The dataset contained information about credit applicants, including demographic data, financial attributes, and loan application details. The target variable indicated whether an applicant was approved or denied for a loan..

## Contents

- Data Exploration: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to understand the dataset's characteristics, identify patterns, and visualize relationships between variables.
- Data Preprocessing: The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
- Model Building: Various machine learning models were trained and evaluated, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Model Evaluation: Model performance metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and confusion matrices were calculated to assess each model's effectiveness.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Grid search was used to optimize hyperparameters for the decision tree and k-NN models.
- Visualization: Visualizations, including confusion matrices and performance comparison plots, were created to better understand the models' performance.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/niiixxon/DMEMLProject.git
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook to reproduce the analysis and results.

## Conclusion

Based on the evaluation metrics and analysis performed, Random Forest was determined to be the most suitable for this dataset and application due to its ability to handle complex relationships in the data, handle missing values well, and provide good accuracy and F1 score. Further improvements and optimizations could be explored in future iterations, such as fine-tuning hyperparameters, feature engineering, or exploring ensemble methods to boost performance even further.
